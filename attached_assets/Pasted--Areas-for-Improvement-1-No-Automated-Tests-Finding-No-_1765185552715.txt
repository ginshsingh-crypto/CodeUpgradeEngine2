⚠️ Areas for Improvement
1. No Automated Tests
Finding: No test files found in the project
Risk: Medium - harder to catch regressions
IMPORTANT

Consider adding at least integration tests for critical paths:

Order creation and payment flow
File upload/download
Authentication
2. Rate Limiting is In-Memory
// Current: In-memory Map
const authAttempts = new Map<string, { count: number; resetTime: number }>();
Issue: Resets on server restart, doesn't scale across instances
Recommendation: For production with multiple instances, use Redis
3. No Email Notifications for Order Status
Users have to manually check the dashboard
Recommendation: Add Resend (already installed!) to notify on:
Order paid → "Thanks! We're working on it"
Order complete → "Your shop drawings are ready"
4. File Cleanup Not Automated
You mentioned deleting files 24 hours after download, but I don't see this implemented.

Recommendation: Add a scheduled job to clean up old output files
5. Stripe Webhook Missing
// Current: Redirect-based payment confirmation
success_url: `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}/?payment=success`
Issue: If user closes browser after payment, order might not be marked paid
Recommendation: Add Stripe webhook handler for checkout.session.completed
6. Package.json Name
"name": "rest-express"  // Generic name from template
Change to "name": "lod400-platform" or similar
🔒 Security Notes
Check	Status	Notes
SQL Injection	✅ Safe	Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries
XSS	✅ Safe	React's default escaping
CSRF	⚠️ Partial	Session-based auth has some protection, but consider adding explicit CSRF tokens
Password Storage	✅ Safe	bcrypt with cost 12
Secrets	✅ Safe	Environment variables, not hardcoded
File Access	✅ Safe	Ownership checks on all file operations
📋 Recommended Improvements (Priority Order)
Priority	Task	Effort	Impact
🔴 High	Add Stripe webhook for payment confirmation	2 hours	Critical for reliability
🔴 High	Add email notifications on order status change	2 hours	UX improvement
🟡 Medium	Implement file cleanup automation	1 hour	Cost savings
🟡 Medium	Add basic API tests	4 hours	Maintainability
🟢 Low	Move rate limiting to Redis	2 hours	Only needed if scaling
🟢 Low	Add CSRF protection	1 hour	Defense in depth
