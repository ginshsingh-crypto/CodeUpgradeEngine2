Here is a critical review of the logic against your specific goal:1. The Critical Gap: Revit File Locking & PackagingGoal: "My client... selects sheets... and my add-in uploads the model"The Problem: Revit locks the currently open model (.rvt). You cannot Zip or Upload a file that is currently being written to by Revit.The Missing Proof: I see the server code receiving the file, but without seeing the C# file PackagingService.cs, I cannot verify if you are handling Central Models correctly.Risk: If your C# code simply tries to Zip the active path, it will crash (File Access Error).Risk: If you are using Worksharing, simply copying the local file is useless because it might be out of sync or missing the central links.Requirement: Your C# code must perform a "Detach from Central" or "SaveAs" to a temporary directory before zipping. If this logic isn't perfect, you will receive corrupted models that you cannot open.2. Stripe Integration & User ExperienceGoal: "Client... pays... and my add-in uploads"The Logic: Your code redirects the user to a Web Browser for payment.POST /api/addin/create-order -> Returns a Stripe URL.Client pays in Chrome/Edge.Stripe Webhook updates DB to paid.The "Not Perfect" Part:Polling Latency: Since the payment happens in the browser, the Revit Add-in has no way of knowing instantly when payment is done. The Add-in must aggressively "poll" (ask the server every 5 seconds) "Is it paid yet?".Browser Disconnect: If the user pays but closes the browser tab too fast, or if the Add-in times out while waiting for the user to find their credit card, the upload will never start.Fix: Ensure your C# code has a long timeout (e.g., 10-15 minutes) for the payment waiting loop.3. Large File Uploads (The 2GB Limit)Goal: "Uploads the model... I download it"The Logic: You are using Signed URLs (PUT request) to Google Cloud Storage.The Risk:No Resumability: The current implementation appears to be a simple "Single HTTP PUT". If a client in a construction site office has a strict firewall or unstable internet (very common), and the upload fails at 99% of a 500MB file, they have to start over from 0%.Timeout: Standard HTTP requests often timeout after 2-5 minutes. Large Revit models take longer.Fix: "1000% Perfect" requires Chunked Uploads (breaking the file into 5MB parts). This usually requires a more complex client-side logic (like TUS protocol) which uppy handles on the web, but your C# HttpClient likely does not.4. Admin Workflow & "Magic"Goal: "I do my magic... and upload the model"Status Logic: The system relies on you manually changing the status.Current: Admin downloads -> Does work -> Uploads -> Manually clicks "Mark Complete".Risk: Human error. If you upload the file but forget to click "Mark Complete", the client never gets the email.Hardcoded Admin:In server/index.ts, the admin email is hardcoded: const SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL = "ginshsingh@gmail.com";.Risk: If you ever change your email or want to add a partner, you have to redeploy the code. This should be in the database or an Environment Variable.5. Deployment Dependency (Replit)The Hook: The code is heavily dependent on Replit specific libraries:@replit/vite-plugin-cartographerstripe-replit-syncHardcoded http://127.0.0.1:1106 sidecar for Object Storage.The Problem: You cannot easily host this on AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean later without rewriting server/objectStorage.ts and server/stripeClient.ts. It locks you into Replit's infrastructure.Summary: Is it 1000% Perfect?FeatureRatingVerdictBackend Logic🟢 95%Excellent use of Typescript, Zod, and Drizzle. Very clean.Auth Security🟢 90%Session management and hashing are good.Stripe Flow🟡 80%Functional, but webhook reliance on Replit URL is fragile.Revit Logic🔴 50%Unknown. Without seeing PackagingService.cs, this is the highest risk of failure.File Upload🟠 70%Lacks chunked/resumable uploads for large BIM files.Immediate Recommendations to FixVerify C# Packaging: Ensure your C# code uses Application.CopyModel or Document.SaveAs to a temp folder before zipping. Never zip the active open file.Robust Uploads: In your C# code, increase the HttpClient.Timeout to Timeout.Infinite or at least 1 hour for the upload endpoint.Webhook Safety: Ensure the Stripe Webhook URL in your Stripe Dashboard matches your production URL exactly. The dynamic creation in index.ts can sometimes create duplicates or point to the wrong dev URL.Remove Hardcoding: Move the Admin Email to an Environment Variable (ADMIN_EMAIL).Verdict: The system will work for a demo or MVP, but for a professional paid service, the file upload/packaging resilience needs to be verified to avoid frustrated clients.
